https://leetcode.com/problems/median-of-two-sorted-arrays/

This wasn't hard at all - in fact it was extremely easy. Took me half an hour, tops. Maybe C#'s LINQ made it so.

As usual, you're not allowed to submit this code or any derivatives of this to pass Leetcode tests. Use this for studying the algorithm instead.
